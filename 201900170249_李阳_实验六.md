## Hardware Environment

* Lenovo Legion Y7000P 2020H(Intel Core i7-10750H, 16GB DDR4)
* Windows 10 Home, Chinese Version

## Software Environment

* Wireshark-win64-3.44

## Purpose

* Take a quick look at DHCP and answer the questions after it.

## Experimental Records

To observe DHCP in action, we'll perform several DHCP-related commands and capture the DHCP messages exchanged as a result of executing these commands.

- Open the Windows Command Prompt application, enter "ipconfig /release". This command releases the current IP address.
- Start up the Wireshark packet sniffer and begin Wireshark packet capture.
- Go back to the Windows Command Prompt and enter "ipconfig /renew". This instructs host to obtain a network configuration, including a new IP address.
- Wait until the “ipconfig /renew” has terminated. Then enter the same command "ipconfig /renew" again. When the second "ipconfig /renew" terminates, enter the command "ipconfig/release" to release the previously-allocated IP address to computer.
- Finally, enter “ipconfig /renew” to again be allocated an IP address for computer and stop Wireshark packet capture.

**After the command "ipconfig /realease"**

- Take a look at the resulting Wireshark window, enter “bootp” in the filter to see only the DHCP packets.

## Answer to Questions

1. DHCP messages sent over UDP.

   ![5.11.4](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.11.4.jpg)

2. For DHCP Discover and DHCP Request, source port numer is 68, destination port number is 67. For DHCP Offer and DHCP ACK, source port number is 67, destination port number is 68. The port numbers are the same as in the example given in this lab assignment.

3. 3c:58:c2:d2:73:b4

   ![5.11.6](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.11.6.jpg)

4. DHCP Request message includes two more options, DHCP Server Identifier and Client Fully Qualified Domain Name.

   ![5.11.7](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.11.7.jpg)

5. The value of the Transaction-ID in the first four(Discover/Offer/Request/ACK) DHCP messages is 0xcd75fc0b, and the values of the Transaction-ID in the second set (Request/ACK) set of DHCP messages is 0x94e95585.

   The Transaction-ID field can aviod DHCP message reception chaos on multiple clients.

6. Stream index is used in the IP datagrams in the four-message exchange. The value of the Stream index in the DHCP Discovery and Requst messages is 14, the  value of the Stream index in the DHCP Offer and ACK messages is 3.

7. 172.25.255.254

8. 172.25.235.177

   ![5.11.11](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.11.11.jpg)

9. Relay agent IP address is 0.0.0.0

10. The router line indicates to the client what its default gateway should be. The subnet mask line tells the client which subnet mask it should use.

11. The client accept the IP address.

    ![5.11.13](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.11.13.jpg)

12. The lease time is the amount of time the DHCP server assigns an IP address to a client. During the lease time, the DHCP server will not assign the IP given to the client to another client, unless it is released by the client. Once the lease time has expired, the IP address can be reused by the DHCP server to give to another client.

    In my experiment, the lease time is 1 hour.

    ![5.11.12](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.11.12.jpg)

13. The client sends a DHCP Release message to cancel its lease on the IP address given to it by the DHCP server. The DHCP server does not send a message back to the client acknowledging the DHCP Release message. If the DHCP Release message from the client is lost, the DHCP server would have to wait until the lease period is over for that IP address until it could reuse it for another client.

14. After receive the DHCP Request messages an ARP packet will be broadcast, which can detects if IP conflicts occur.
