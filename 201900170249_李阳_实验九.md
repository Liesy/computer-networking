## Hardware Environment

* Lenovo Legion Y7000P 2020H(Intel Core i7-10750H, 16GB DDR4)
* Windows 10 Home, Chinese Version

## Software Environment

* Wireshark-win64-3.44

## Purpose

* Analyzing a trace of IP datagrams sent and received by an execution of the traceroute program.
* Investigate the various fields in the IP datagram, and study IP fragmentation in detail.

## Experimental Records

### Capturing packets from an execution of traceroute

- Start up Wireshark and begin packet capture and then press OK on the Wireshark Packet Capture Options screen.
- Start up pingplotter and enter the name of a target destination in the "Address to Trace Window".
- Select the menu item Edit->Advanced Options->Packet Options and enter a value of 56 in the Packet Size field and then press OK.
- Press the Trace button, send a set of datagrams with a longer length, by selecting Edit->Advanced Options->Packet Options and enter a value of 2000 in the Packet Size field and then press OK. Then press the Resume button.
- Send a set of datagrams with a longer length, by selecting Edit->Advanced Options->Packet Options and enter a value of 3500 in the Packet Size field and then press OK. Then press the Resume button.
- Stop Wireshark tracing.

### A look at the captured trace

- In the trace, we should be able to see the series of ICMP Echo Request sent by computer and the ICMP TTL-exceeded messages returned to computer by the intermediate routers.

- Sort the traced packets according to IP source address by clicking on the Source column header; Select the first ICMP Echo Request message sent by computer, and expand the Internet Protocol portion in the "details of selected packet header" window.

- Find the series of ICMP TTL-exceeded replies sent to computer by the nearest (first hop) router.

## Answer to Questions

1. 192.168.1.102

2. ICMP

3. 20 bytes are in the IP header, the length of the payload of the IP datagram is 84 - 20 = 64 bytes.

4. 

5. Identification, Time to Live and Header Checksum always change from one datagram to the next within this series of ICMP messages sent by computer.
