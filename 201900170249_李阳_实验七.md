| Student Number | Name | Class  | Lab Title | Period |     Date     |
| :------------: | :--: | :----: | :-------: | :----: | :----------: |
|  201900170249  | 李阳 | 智能19 | NAT v8.0  |   2h   | May 18, 2021 |

## Hardware Environment

* Lenovo Legion Y7000P 2020H(Intel Core i7-10750H, 16GB DDR4)
* Windows 10 Home, Chinese Version

## Software Environment

* Wireshark-win64-3.44

## Purpose

* Investigate the behavior of the NAT protocol using Wireshark trace files that the lab had captured.

## Experimental Records

- Download the zip file and extract the files need for this lab.
- Open the NAT_home_side file, and use a Wireshark filter so that only frames containing HTTP messages are
  displayed from the trace file.
- Focus on the two HTTP messages (GET and 200 OK) and the TCP SYN and ACK segments identified above, and locate these two HTTP messages and two TCP segments in the trace file (NAT_ISP_side) captured on the link between the router and the ISP.
- Open the NAT_ISP_side and answer the questions.

## Answer to Questions

1. IP address of the client: 192.168.1.100

   ![5.18.1](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.1.jpg)

3. Source IP address: 192.168.1.100, Destination IP addresses: 64.233.169.104

   TCP source port: 4335, Destination port: 80

4. The corresponding 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server at time 7.158797, the source IP addresses is 64.233.169.104 ,the destination IP addresses is 192.168.1.100, TCP source port is 80, destination port is 4335.

   ![5.18.3](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.3.jpg)

5. The client-to-server TCP SYN segment sent at time 7.075657, the source IP address is 192.168.1.100, destination IP address is 64.233.169.104, source port is 4335, destination port is 80.

   ![5.18.4](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.4.jpg)

   The ACK sent in response to the SYN at time 7.108986, the source IP address is 64.233.169.104, destination IP address is 192.168.1.100, source port is 80, destination port is 4335.

   ![5.18.5](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.5.jpg)

6. Message appear in the NAT_ISP_side trace file at time 6.069168, the source IP address is 71.192.34.104, destination IP address is 64.233.169.104, TCP source port is 4335, destination port is 80.

   Source and destination ports, destination IP address are the same, source IP address is different.

   ![5.18.6](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.6.jpg)

7. Since the IP source address has changed, and the checksum includes the value of the source IP address, the checksum has changed.

   ![5.18.7](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.7.jpg)

7. The first 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server at time 6.117570, the source IP address is 64.233.169.104, destination IP address is 71.192.34.104, TCP source port is 80, destination port is 4335.

   Source and destination ports,  source IP address are the same, destination IP address is different.

   ![5.18.8](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\5.18.8.jpg)

9. The client-to-server TCP SYN segment captured at time 6.035475, the source IP address is 71.192.34.104, destination IP address is 64.233.169.104, source port is 4335, destination port is 80.

   Source and destination ports, destination IP address are the same, source IP address is different.

   ![5.18.9](D:\大二下\计网\computer-networking\image\5.18.9.jpg)

   The server-to-client TCP ACK segment captured at time 6.067775, the source IP address is 64.233.169.104, destination IP address is 71.192.34.104, source port is 80, destination port is 4335.

   Source and destination ports,  source IP address are the same, destination IP address is different.
